In this project, this was my first interaction with GODOT, and I utilized this as a way to learn more about the program and its capabilities, 
in which I tried to explore the most. As for the scene itself, I was inspired by scenes from the Mario games that I used to play on the WII, 
but designed it to be more of a park setting for personalization. It was really interesting to see how the child and parent nodes worked together within a scene to curate 
symmetry and reduce repetitive patterns for the creator. In this second attempt, I made the MainScene.tcsn the main file and then a nested scene for the overlapping trees.
